// This example was taken from the "Rust Compiler Error Index", as this is an example for a certain error index that I
// think it is worth testing the tool for. (Remember that the tool deals with erroneous programs, and the error index
// indeed prides examples with errors.) Maybe this example has been modified (or extended). This was sometimes needed
// in order to make sure that there also is an error when using Rust edition 2018 with NLL. (The index sometimes
// presents examples that are only erroneous when using edition 2015 with lexical lifetimes)
//
// This example is specific for error E0478. (example 0)

#![allow(unused)]
// Check that the explicit lifetime bound (`'SnowWhite`, in this example) must
// outlive all the superbounds from the trait (`'kiss`, in this example).

fn main() {
trait Wedding<'t>: 't { }

struct Prince<'kiss, 'SnowWhite> {
    child: Box<Wedding<'kiss> + 'SnowWhite>,
    // error: lifetime bound not satisfied
}
