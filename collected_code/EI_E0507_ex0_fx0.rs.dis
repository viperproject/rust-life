// This example was taken from the "Rust Compiler Error Index", as this is an example for a certain error index that I
// think it is worth testing the tool for. (Remember that the tool deals with erroneous programs, and the error index
// indeed prides examples with errors.) Maybe this example has been modified (or extended). This was sometimes needed
// in order to make sure that there also is an error when using Rust edition 2018 with NLL. (The index sometimes
// presents examples that are only erroneous when using edition 2015 with lexical lifetimes)
//
// This example is specific for error E0507. (example 0)
// This was slightly extended in order to try to enable Rust Life to analyse it. But since Rust Life does not produce
// output for this examples, we do consider it (and the Error E0507) to not be in our scope (for now).
